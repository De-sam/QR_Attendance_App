# QR_Attendance_App

A QR attendance app system is designed to streamline and automate tracking attendance for various purposes using QR (Quick Response) codes.

## Why we built it?

The QR attendance app is built to track attendance of all categories of members in an Organization and could be used potentially in a Payroll system.

## How it works

- Users are required to create an account and Login to the app
- The app allows users to scan a QR code that is randomly generated each day to verify their attendance.
- The app records their attendance in a database and displays it in a dashboard

## Platforms

This is a web application and as such can work on any mobile devices, desktop, laptops etc as long as they are connected to the internet.
